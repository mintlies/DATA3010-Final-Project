# Predicting a Student's Academic Success or Dropout
## Roselle Deinla & Andrea Nguyen

This project is meant to be a hands-on approch with the machine learning topics and models discussed in our third-year Data Science course, DATA3010 - Data Science with Real World Data Sets (Completed Fall 2023). The main language of this project is Python, with emphasis on utilizing the sci-kit learn (sklearn) library.

Working with the '[Predict student's dropout and academic success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)' dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, it is comprised of information collected on graduate, dropout and currently enrolled students of an unnamed post-secondary institution. 

The goal of this project is to produce the two most accurate possible models that can predict whether a student will graduate or dropout of their studies. 
We have trained four different binary classification models and took into account different scores to determine the best contenders.

The specific models of interest are:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVC)
